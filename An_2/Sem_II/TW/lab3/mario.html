        <h1>Super Mario Brothers</h1>
        <p>
            Super Mario Bros is a platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment
            System
            (NES).
            The successor to the 1983 arcade game Mario Bros and the first game in the Super Mario series, it was first
            released
            in 1985 for the Famicom in Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka as "a grand culmination" of the Famicom team's
            three
            years of game mechanics and programming, drawing from their experiences working on Devil World and the
            side-scrollers Excitebike and Kung Fu.

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>Players control Mario, or his brother Luigi in the multiplayer mode, as they traverse the Mushroom
            Kingdom to
            rescue
            Princess Toadstool from King Koopa (later named Bowser). They traverse side-scrolling stages while
            avoiding
            hazards
            such as enemies and pits with the aid of power-ups such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Starman.
