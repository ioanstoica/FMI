                    In the history of video games, the third generation of game consoles, commonly referred to as the
                    8-bit
                    era,
                    began on July 15, 1983, with the Japanese release of two systems: Nintendo's Family Computer
                    (commonly
                    abbreviated to Famicom) and Sega's SG-1000. This generation marked the end of the video game crash
                    of
                    1983,
                    and a shift in the dominance of home video game manufacturers from the United States to Japan. The
                    best-selling console of this generation was the NES/Famicom from Nintendo, followed by the Sega
                    Master
                    System (the improved successor to the SG-1000), and the Atari 7800. Although the previous generation
                    of
                    consoles had also used 8-bit processors, it was at the end of the third generation that home
                    consoles
                    were
                    first labeled and marketed by their "bits".

                <p>NES was shipped with only 4 KB of RAM, but "mapper" hardware on the cartridge expanded its
                    capabilities, supporting games as large as 1 MB.</p>

            8-bit color graphics are a method of storing image information in a computer's memory or in an image file,
            so that each pixel is represented by 8 bits (1 byte). The maximum number of colors that can be displayed at
            any one time is 256 or 2^8.

            <h1>Usage</h1>
            <p>Because of the low amount of memory and resultant higher speeds of 8-bit color images, 8-bit color was a
                common ground among computer graphics development until more memory and higher CPU speeds became readily
                available to consumers. 8-bit color was used in many different applications including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The MSX2 series of personal computer</li>
                <li>The Atari Falcon</li>
                <li>Wearable OS smartwatches with ambient displays</li>
                <li>Many scanners use an 8-bit grey scale as their standard.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Even though it is now outdated for most consumer applications, 8-bit color encoding can still be useful
                in
                imaging systems with limited data bandwidth or memory capacity. For example, both Mars Exploration
                Rovers
                used an 8-bit grayscale format for navigation imaging.</p>

            <h1>8-bit music</h1>
            <p>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune">Chiptune</a> , also known as chip music or 8-bit music,
                is
                a style of
                synthesized electronic music made using the programmable sound generator sound chips or synthesizers in
                vintage arcade machines, computers and video game consoles. The term is commonly used to refer to
                tracker
                format music which intentionally sounds similar to older PSG-created music (this is the original meaning
                of
                the term), as well as music that combines PSG sounds with modern musical styles. It has been described
                as
                "an interpretation of many genres" since any existing song can be arranged in a chiptune style defined
                more
                by choice of instrument and timbre than specific style elements.

            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>
                A waveform generator is a fundamental module in a sound synthesis system. A waveform generator usually
                produces a basic geometrical waveform with a fixed or variable timbre and variable pitch. Common
                waveform
                generator configurations usually included two or three simple waveforms and often a single
                pseudo-random-noise generator. Available waveforms often included pulse wave (whose timbre can be varied
                by
                modifying the duty cycle), square wave (a symmetrical pulse wave producing only odd overtones), triangle
                wave (which has a fixed timbre containing only odd harmonics, but is softer than a square wave), and
                sawtooth wave (which has a bright raspy timbre and contains odd and even harmonics). Two notable
                examples of
                systems employing this technology were the Nintendo Game Boy portable game console and the Commodore 64
                personal computer.
